## Project Description
### Why did I build this project?
* The purpose of the project was to build an online note taker, so that a
 user can save notes with a title and text for future reference and then delete the note when it is no longer needed. As this project required the data to be saved to the server unlike previous ones.
### What problems does this project overcome?
* The toughest part of this project was using Heroku and Express.js. I struggled with this great as back-end development is new to me. Figuring out the logic in how to remove a note while bumping up others placed was a challenge as well.
### What new skills did I learn?
* I gained knowledge on how to use Heroku, Postman and Express properly, while using the knowledge I already have on front-end development.
